# BRIW

Academy 2019 MiniProject


# V1.0
First version, before changing the project to adjust the project goal to the Slack bot. 
In this version you can create rounds in a way not oriented to the collaboration of other users. Only from the person who is using the application in the terminal.

# V1.1

Restructuring of the project, to adapt it more to a Python project, allowing a better use of imports or the creation of the project as a package for export. 
Added unit tests for most general project functions.
Minor fixes.
