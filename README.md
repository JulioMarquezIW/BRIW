# BRIW

Academy 2019 MiniProject

This project allows you to have an application that allows you to create rounds of drinks for a group of people, which one of them is going to prepare, and can ask the rest of the people what drinks they want.

## Execute the project
```
python3 -m briw
```



# V1.0
In this version you interact with the command console to interact with the user.
In this version you can create rounds in a way not oriented to the collaboration of other users. Only from the person who is using the application in the terminal.

# V1.1

Restructuring of the project, to adapt it more to a Python project, allowing a better use of imports or the creation of the project as a package for export. 
Added unit tests for most general project functions.
Minor fixes.

Execute tests: 
```
python3 -m briw.tests.test_functions -v
```
